You are a precise data extraction assistant. Extract structured course information from the following university timetable text. 

For each course listing, extract these fields in JSON format:
{{
    "crn": string,                    # Course Reference Number
    "course_code": string,            # e.g., "AOE-2024"
    "title": string,                  # Course title
    "type": string,                   # Type of class (Lecture, Lab, etc.)
    "modality": string,               # e.g., "Face-to-Face Instruction", "Online: Asynchronous"
    "credits": number or range,       # Credit hours (can be range like "1 TO 19")
    "enrollment": {{
        "available": number,          # Number of seats available
        "capacity": number           # Total capacity
    }},
    "instructor": string,             # Primary instructor
    "schedule": {{
        "days": [string],            # List of days (M, T, W, R, F)
        "start_time": string,        # Start time in 24hr format
        "end_time": string,          # End time in 24hr format
        "location": string           # Building and room number
    }},
    "exam_code": string,             # Exam scheduling code
    "comments": string,              # Any additional notes or requirements
    "cross_listed": boolean          # If course appears to be cross-listed
}}

Requirements:
1. Maintain exact spellings and capitalizations from source
2. Convert times to 24-hour format (e.g., "9:05AM" → "09:05")
3. Split combined days into array (e.g., "MWF" → ["M", "W", "F"])
4. For ARR (arranged) courses:
   - Set schedule.days to empty array
   - Set times to null
   - Set location to "ARR"
5. Preserve all numbers as numeric types where appropriate
6. Include comments field only if comments exist
7. Set cross_listed true if course appears in multiple departments
